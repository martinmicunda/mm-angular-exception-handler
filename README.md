 mm-angular-exception-handler
===================

The `mm.exceptionHandler` module override Angular's default  [`$exceptionHandler`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$exceptionHandler), it preserves the default behaviour (logging to the console by [`mm.Logger`](https://github.com/martinmicunda/mm-logger) but also posts the error to [`Sentry`](https://getsentry.com/) or some custom reporting tool.

> **Requirements:** AngularJS 1.2+, mm-angular-logger 0.3+ 

> **File Size:** 14.36Kb minified, 893b gzipped

## Install

Install via bower:
```bash
$ bower install mm-angular-exception-handler
```

Inject the `mm.exceptionHandler` module into your app:
```js
var app = angular.module('ExceptionDemo', [
    'mm.exceptionHandler'
]);
```

## Configuration
By default posting error to reporting tool is turn off. This can be turn on by configuring the `$exceptionHandlerProvider`.

### Custom reporting tool:
It's up to you to provide your own back end implementation that accept `post` json request. Have look for simple example in [demo](demo/index.html) and [gulp serve](https://github.com/martinmicunda/mm-angular-exception-handler/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L243) task.

```js
app.config(['$exceptionHandlerProvider', function (cfg) {
    cfg.setConfigAppErrorPrefix('demoApp');
    cfg.setConfigCustomDns('http://localhost:3000/error');
}]);
```

### Sentry reporting tool:
You need to create Sentry account to be able to send error data to [`Sentry`](https://getsentry.com/).

```html
<script src="//cdn.ravenjs.com/1.1.15/raven.min.js"></script>
```
```js
app.config(['$exceptionHandlerProvider', function (cfg) {
    var ravenConfig = {logger: 'javascript'};
    cfg.setConfigAppErrorPrefix('demoApp');
    cfg.setConfigRavenDns('https://7be.......491@app.getsentry.com/2...2');
    cfg.setConfigRavenConfig(ravenConfig);
}]);
```

## Developers
Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/martinmicunda/mm-angular-exception-handler.git`. 

The `mm-angular-exception-handler` is tested with `karma` against the latest stable release of AngularJS.

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp test
```
You can build the latest version using `gulp`.
```bash
$ gulp build
```
You can quickly hack around with:
```
$ gulp serve
```

## Release

> During the release process only [`dist`](dist), [`package.json`](package.json), [`bower.json`](bower.json) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) files should be edited and all steps should be done with **gulp tasks** and **not manually**!

- To push a new release:
  1. Update [`package.json`](package.json) and [`bower.json`](bower.json) version to new version with `gulp bump --type=(major|minor|patch)` 
  2. Build dist files with `gulp build`
  3. Generate changelog with `gulp changelog`
  4. Go through the changelog, and fix any mistakes or clarify any unclear commit messages
  5. Commit and push [`dist`](dist/), [`package.json`](package.json), [`bower.json`](bower.json) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) with `gulp release` 

## Versioning

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
